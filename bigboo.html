        <p id="second2">The Big Boo first appears in Super Mario World. Here, he is a hidden boss only 
            found in the secret door of the Donut Secret House, which he inhabits. He has two normal Boos 
            which accompany him in battle. The way he behaves is slightly different from that of other Big Boos: 
            he floats in the air above and around Mario in a downward arching pattern rather than chasing him 
            and does not even stop when being looked at. The Big Boo can only be injured when he is visible, so 
            Mario has to throw a Grab Block at him at the right moment. Once hurt, he puts his hands on his face and 
            becomes almost invisible so Mario cannot injure Big Boo. He then moves somewhere else and reappears with his 
            face uncovered. The Big Boo needs to be hit three times to be defeated. Mario or Luigi can touch the boss without 
            being hurt, but must be wary of the normal Boos. Once the Big Boo is defeated, a new path is revealed on the overworld, 
            leading to Star World.
