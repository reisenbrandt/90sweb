        <p id="second2">Bowser reappears in Super Mario World. Here, he kidnaps Princess Toadstool while she is
            vacationing with the Mario Bros. in Dinosaur Land. His Koopalings also capture several of 
            the native Yoshis, trapping them in eggs guarded by them in one of their seven castles. 
            Yoshi himself attempts to stop them, but Bowser traps him in an egg as well. Bowser's boss 
            fight in Super Mario World has him on the roof of his castle, riding in his Koopa Clown Car. He 
            throws Mechakoopas and Big Steelies at the player, and tries to ground pound him as the battle progresses. 
            After hitting Bowser with a Mechakoopa, he will sink into his car for a short time, while casting flames in the air 
            and having them rain down. Bowser will also attempt to ram into Mario with his Koopa Clown Car before returning to his 
            previous tactics. Upon being defeated, he ends up losing control of his Koopa Clown Car and is ultimately forced to release 
            Princess Toadstool upon the car turning upside down, before being knocked into the distance. Prior to fighting him, he also 
            briefly appears in the Valley of Bowser Map's background flying around in his Koopa Clown Car, although only his eyes can be 
            seen in the darkness, and only a silhouette appears during the occasional thunderclap. In the GBA remake, he is absent 
            entirely after his level is cleared.
