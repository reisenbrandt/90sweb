            kidnaps Toadstool again. He takes her to his castle in the Valley of Bowser. 
            He holds her inside his Koopa Clown Car during his battle with the Bros., which allows 
            her to throw them items. After she is rescued, Toadstool kisses Mario (or Luigi) on the cheek, 
            and during the credits, travels with Mario, Luigi, and Yoshi to Yoshi's House to observe the hatching of the 
            rescued eggs with the other Yoshis.
