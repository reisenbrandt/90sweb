        <p id="second2">Luigi appears in Super Mario World again as a palette swap of Mario, having his brother's abilities and properties, 
            and can only be played by the second player in a 2-player game. 
            While his appearance was updated in the SNES rerelease, Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World, 
            his attributes stayed the same, though his actions differed from Mario's. 
            In the GBA port, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2, Luigi regained his high jump and low traction 
            attributes and can be switched out with Mario during the single player adventure, while his appearance borrowed 
            elements from his design in Super Mario Bros. 2.
